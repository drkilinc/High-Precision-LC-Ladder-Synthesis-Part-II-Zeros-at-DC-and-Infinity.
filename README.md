High Precision LC Ladder Synthesis Part II: Immittance Synthesis With Transmission Zeros at DC and Infinity.

Abstract:
In this paper, a novel, high precision bandpass LC ladder synthesis algorithm is presented. The new algorithm directly works on the rational form of a positive real driving point input immittance F(p)=a(p)/b(p) which describes a bandpass
LC ladder network in resistive termination. In the new method, firstly, poles at p=0 are removed from F(p), then remaining poles at infinity are extracted. After each pole extraction, coefficients of the polynomial a(p) and b(p) are refined employing the parametric approach to yield an exact bandpass LC ladder which in turn prevents the accumulation of the numerical errors in the course of synthesis. Thus, at the end of synthesis process, a bandpass LC ladder is obtained with high numerical precision.
